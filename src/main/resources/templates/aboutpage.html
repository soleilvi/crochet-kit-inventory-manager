        Play 'n Hooky is a company dedicated to making crochet more accessible to children and adults who maybe always
        wanted to learn, but never knew where to start. We make amigurumi kits that come with everything that you need
        to crochet a stuffed friend, including easy-to-follow patterns that also come in a video format for those that
        prefer to view every step.
